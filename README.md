Smart Contract Documentation for "Bustaaal"
Introduction:
The "Bustaaal" smart contract is a simple Ethereum-based token contract deployed on the Redbelly Devnet. It uses the ERC-20 standard and provides basic functionalities for transferring tokens between addresses.

Installation:
To deploy the "Bustaaal" smart contract, follow these steps:
Ensure you have an Ethereum development environment set up.
Deploy the contract to the Redbelly Devnet by using the provided Solidity code.
Interact with the contract using a tool like Remix or Truffle.

Usage:
Use the transfer function to send tokens to another address:
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance.");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[recipient] += amount;
}

Parameters:
recipient: The address to which you want to send tokens.
amount: The number of tokens to send.

Example:
// Example: Sending 100 tokens to 0xRecipientAddress
contractInstance.transfer(0xRecipientAddress, 100);

Checking Balances:
You can check the balance of any address using the balances mapping:
// Example: Check balance of an address
uint256 balance = contractInstance.balances(0xAddressToCheck);

Important Notes:
Ensure you have sufficient balance before initiating a transfer.
Token transfers will only be successful if the sender has enough tokens.
Double-check the addresses provided during deployment and interaction.

Security Considerations:
Always double-check the recipient's address to avoid accidental token loss.
Ensure your private keys are secure and do not share them with unauthorized parties.
Test transactions on the Redbelly Devnet before using the contract on the mainnet.
